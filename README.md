# Raman barcode and PCA code snips
Code used to generate barcoded Raman spectra and PCA (Principal Component Analysis) results from .txt files

This code can be expanded upon, edited and used by anyone. It is a snip of code I used to generate my results.

The input file should contain one group of spectra to be barcoded.

Brief instructions are given in the PCA code to run it.
